## Programming Languages ##
CPP- Fastest, High Learning Curve

Java -2 times slower than CPP, High Learning Curve, Support for bigint

Python- Slowest (5 times slower than CPP), Beginner Friednly, Great for String Manipulation and bigint

## Online Judges ##

1.  [Codechef]( https://www.codechef.com/ "Codechef")

  * Long Challenge starts from first Friday of every month and lasts for 10 days. 
  * Problems are divided into different datasets where difficulty increases as dataset grows larger.
  * Cook off is a short contest with duration of two and half hours. Happens on Sunday after Codechef Long ends.
  * Lunchtime is also a short contest with duration of three hours.
  
2.  [Codeforces]( https://codeforces.com/ "Codeforces")
* 6 to 10 contests every month with duration of 2 hours.

3.  [Atcoder]( https://atcoder.jp/ "Atcoder")
* 3 to 4 contests every month with duration of 100 minutes. Created by a team of highly-rated Japanese competitive     programmers.

4.  [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/) - 
* 2 to 3 contests every month with duration of 90 minutes. 
* Considered to be one of the most prestigious organizations when it comes to technology competitions.
* Problems here are typically more challenging than others and Topcoder therefore appeals to many elite programmers.

5.  [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/)
* Highly-esteemed programming competitions.
* The competition consists of unique programming challenges which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. 
* Competitors may use any programming language and development environment to obtain their solutions. 


6.  [Hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

7.  [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) 
* Project Euler features a stunning set of good math problems.

8.  [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)


9.  [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/)
* The SPOJ platform is centered around an online judge system. 
* It holds a staggering amount of problems prepared by its community of problem setters or taken from previous programming contests, some of which are great problems for practice (refer to the [Problem classifiers](#problem-classifiers) section). SPOJ also allows advanced users to organize contests under their own rules.
