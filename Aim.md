##  Our Aim
* The idea is to code everyday, turning it into a habit.Since coding involves concept that continuously build on each other, if you go several days without
coding, a fair amount of knowledge is lost.
* Consistency is very important when starting with competitive coding. We recommend making a
commitment to code every day. Muscle Memory plays a large part in programming and committing to
coding everyday will help develop the same.
* Although it may seem daunting at first, consider starting small with maybe 30/45/minutes or 1 hour
every day and working your way up from there.
* We further provide a platform for blog post if you wish to write article to share your experience, offer
some guide or any technical-information to the community.
